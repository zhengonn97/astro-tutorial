Proper selection is needed to have better fuel efficiency, increase engine and power train lifespan and reduced cab operator fatigue.

**<33 BT>** Common types include:-

- bucket teeth - used on excavators / loaders for digging
- cutting edges - used on dozers and graders for leveling and grading
- blades - used on dozers for pushing and moving material
