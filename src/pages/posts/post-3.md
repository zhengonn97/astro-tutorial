## \[RG] REDUCTION GEAR PARTS

In this category we have items related to the reduction gear component, such as the gears (sun, ring, planet, pinion), carriers, shafts, bearings, thrust washers, housing, drum sprockets, bolts nuts etc.

## \[FP] FRICTION DISC & PLATE

Friction plates are crucial components in a swing motor's braking system and travel motors.

In swing motors, they provide controlled friction for braking, swing motion control and heat dissipation. When a brake is engaged, they press against a mating surface to slow down the rotation of the excavator upper structure. It controls the amount of friction to ensure smooth turns of the swing motions. Friction generates heat and these plates are designed to withstand heat and prevent overheating.

In travel motors, they are used in conjunction with gears and bearings etc. to increase gripping power and ensure everything is secure such that torque transfer is efficient.
